To develop a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, you can follow these steps:

Load the Iris Dataset: Load the Iris dataset, which is available in scikit-learn's datasets module.

Explore the Data: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

Preprocess the Data: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as splitting the data into training and testing sets, scaling features, or encoding labels.

Select a Model: Choose a machine learning model suitable for classification tasks. For simplicity, let's start with a classic model like Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Train the Model: Train the selected model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data.

Optional: Try Other Models: Experiment with other classification algorithms available in scikit-learn, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks using TensorFlow.
